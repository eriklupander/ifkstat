After working with this all day, I finally found a solution, although I am not sure this is really the ideal fix.  It looks like the dependencies for jboss logging are not correct in that module.  So I added the following to modules/org/jboss/logging/main/module.xml:

 

<dependencies>

    <module name="org.jboss.logmanager"/>

 

    <!-- added these 2 dependencies -->

    <module name="org.apache.log4j"/>

    <module name="org.slf4j"/>

</dependencies>
